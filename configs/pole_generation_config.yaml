# Default configuration for pole generation

# to do, fix far fuse obj id, add mod vert with cross arm, also gotta change ats and fuse, sould be like aetx_w_fuse and aetx_w_ats as own stuff so probs dont get super messed up
# Basic pole properties

# Equipment probabilities

  bare: 20            # Chance of having bare pole (just insulators)
  aetx: 25            # Chance of having AETX when eligible (2+ phases)
  fuse: 40  # When AETX present, 60% chance it's with fuse
  ats: 50   # When AETX present, 40% chance it's with ATS
  als: 40
